# Real-Time-Monitoring-Dashboard
The motivation behind this project is to create a lightweight, user-friendly, and real-time monitoring dashboard that offers advanced functionalities like live CPU graphs, process control (termination), GPU usage display, and the ability to save reports for future reference. 
ðŸš€ Features
	â€¢	Live CPU Usage Graph with matplotlib
	â€¢	GPU Usage Monitoring using GPUtil (NVIDIA GPUs only)
	â€¢	Search and Filter processes by name, CPU %, and memory %
	â€¢	Kill Individual or Multiple Processes with confirmation dialogs
	â€¢	Process Details Popup on double-click (PID, threads, core, status, etc.)
	â€¢	Save Process List to File for logging or debugging
	â€¢	Selection Persistence across refresh cycles
	â€¢	Auto-refresh every 5 seconds

ðŸ“¦ Built With
	â€¢	tkinter â€“ for GUI development
	â€¢	psutil â€“ to interact with system processes and performance metrics
	â€¢	GPUtil â€“ for GPU monitoring (optional, fallback included)
	â€¢	matplotlib â€“ to plot CPU usage over time
	â€¢	threading â€“ to run monitoring in the background without freezing the GUI
